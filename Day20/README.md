#### **Project 01**

1.  **Inventory Plugins**

    -   **Activity**: Configure a dynamic inventory plugin to manage a
        > growing number of web servers dynamically. Integrate the
        > plugin with Ansible to automatically detect and configure
        > servers in various environments.

    -   **Deliverable**: Dynamic inventory configuration file or script,
        > demonstrating the ability to automatically update the
        > inventory based on real-time server data.

2.  **Performance Tuning**

    -   **Activity**: Tune Ansible performance by adjusting settings
        > such as parallel execution (forks), optimizing playbook tasks,
        > and reducing playbook run time.

    -   **Deliverable**: Optimized ansible.cfg configuration file,
        > performance benchmarks, and documentation detailing changes
        > made for performance improvement.

3.  **Debugging and Troubleshooting Playbooks**

    -   **Activity**: Implement debugging strategies to identify and
        > resolve issues in playbooks, including setting up verbose
        > output and advanced error handling.

    -   **Deliverable**: Debugged playbooks with enhanced error handling
        > and logging, including a troubleshooting guide with common
        > issues and solutions.

4.  **Exploring Advanced Modules**

    -   **Activity**: Use advanced Ansible modules such as
        > docker\_container to manage containerized applications and
        > aws\_ec2 for AWS infrastructure management, demonstrating
        > their integration and usage.

    -   **Deliverable**: Playbooks showcasing the deployment and
        > management of Docker containers and AWS EC2 instances, along
        > with documentation on the benefits and configurations of these
        > advanced modules.
